I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline

You know I can't escape this hell I was raised in
My minds not right guess that's why I caved in

I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline
I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline

I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline
I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline

Every day is just a waking nightmare
New smile new face is how we survive here
Watch what you say and how you pray
Cause now a days I feel there's always something wrong

Just take these drugs and shut your mouth
Nothings wrong quit crying out
It's for attention cutting now
No one cares about you

You know I can't escape this hell I was raised in
My minds not right guess that's why I caved in

I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline
I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline

I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline
I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline

She asked why I'm always in the studio
I got a lot different problems they won't let me go
It's way too casual the way you always acting up
Everything you ever said to me ain't adding up

But I bet she wanna see me
When I pull up in this gini
Yeah we got it on own our
This shit really wasn't that easy
I put money on myself
Like I'm only thing she needed
All types no ice
She said you cold I know I'm freezing yeah

Every day is just a waking nightmare
New smile new face is how we survive here
Watch what you say and how you pray
Cause now a days I feel there's always something wrong

I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline
I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline

I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline
I guess I'm fucked up beyond all belief
Might just throw up while I drink some gasoline
