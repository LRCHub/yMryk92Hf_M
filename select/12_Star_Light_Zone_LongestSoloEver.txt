In the starlight
Come unto me and hold me tight
Now's the time
Starry sky
Wipe your tear there is no need for fright
Not tonight
In the starlight
You'll be safe with me all tonight
All the time
No more fight
I'll protect you for what is right
In my arms and- i will set you free
Its the place to be
Hold my hand now- and come fly with me
It is our destiny
In the sky now - can you feel the breeze
Does it weaken your knees
Soaring up high - across all the trees
Its not a dream
In the midnight
The reflection of you tonight
Feels so right
Perfect light
I could see you this one last time
One last night
I ll hold you there
All these feelings that we must share
We do care
Stop and stare
I can feel your heartbeat right there
These emotions - they ll carry on strong
Its where tey belong
Us together - its our love song
But it may not be long
Can you feel it - both of us happy
How we are supposed to be
In y thoughts and in my memory
Eternally
